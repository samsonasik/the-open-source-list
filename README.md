# Ryan's Open Source List

Hi, my name is Ryan, and at any given time, there's about a million cool solutions,
libraries, improvements and bug fixes that I want to work on in the open source world.
Probably like you, when I'm coding, I'm constantly thinking "Dang, why doesn't it just do X".
That's the point of this list: to keep track of those "things" until I (or maybe you!) have
time to be the hero, and make things better.

If you're reading this and find something that's interesting to you, hey! Comment on the
issue and get working on it! Nothing makes me happier than when other great developers
solve a problem or add a feature that I want (and they usually do a better job than I
would anyways). If you *do* want to take on an issue, you're awesome, and I'm thrilled
to discuss and work on it.

*Disclaimer*: not all of my ideas are good... maybe half of them are decent, at best :).
This is a space for brainstorming, finding the gems, then contributing them back to the world.
